BrowserStack could offer a service where it continuously tests a mobile app on a range of real devices and uses this system to automatically detect any code changes that cause a performance regression (e.g., increased battery drain or slower UI response) on a specific device."

The BLE vulnerability testing is a unique and valuable security check, while the patented performance regression detection provides a defensible, high-value feature that addresses a major pain point for mobile developers."
